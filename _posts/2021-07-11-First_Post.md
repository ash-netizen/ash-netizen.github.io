## wrong information spreads way faster than the right one. No thanks to Recommendation systems.

The filter bubble–the idea that online recommendation engines learn what we like and thus keep us only reading things we agree with–has evolved. Algorithms, network effects, and zero-cost publishing are enabling crackpot theories to go viral, and—unchecked—these ideas are impacting the decisions of policy makers and shaping public opinion, whether they are verified or not.

### Social Media Facts

once People join a single conspiracy-minded [Facebook] group , they are algorithmically routed to a plethora of others so basically rather than pulling a user out of the rabit hole , the recommendation engine pushes them further in.


Facebook’s news feed and personalized search delivers results that are tailored just to us because a social network’s business is to keep us interested and happy. Feeling good drives engagement and more time spent on a site, and that keeps a user targetable with advertisements for longer. Pariser argues that this nearly invisible editing of the Internet limits what we see—and that it will “ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.”
